# Photo captions (optional overrides)
# Captions are automatically generated from filenames by removing:
# - File extensions (e.g., .jpg, .png)
# - Leading numbers and separators (e.g., "01. ", "02-")
#
# Example: "01. Tahoe.jpg" → caption: "Tahoe"
#
# If you want to override the auto-generated caption for a specific photo,
# add it here. The key is the image filename (e.g., "01. Tahoe.jpg")
# and the value is your custom caption text.

  # Example override:
  # "01. Tahoe.jpg": "Lake Tahoe at sunset"
