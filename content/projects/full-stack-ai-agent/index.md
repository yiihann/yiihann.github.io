An **agentic AI system** that guides developers from high-level intent to **production-ready full-stack code**, orchestrating API recommendation, documentation retrieval, and code generation through a multi-agent workflow.

The system decomposes the development process into specialized agents for **API selection**, **documentation scraping and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**, **backend/frontend code synthesis**, and **automated code review**, enabling fast and reliable API integration, reducing integration time from documentation exploration to deployable code.
