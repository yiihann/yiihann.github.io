An **ML- and optimization-driven decision-support system** for housing affordability in California, framing housing selection as a **multi-objective optimization problem** over affordability, safety, and accessibility rather than a traditional recommender system.

The project combines **predictive modeling** (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) with **constraint-based optimization** (MILP and heuristic methods) to maximize Quality of Life (QoL) under real-world affordability and policy constraints, enabling **scenario analysis for individual and policy-level evaluation**.
